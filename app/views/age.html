<p><b>Season Premiere:</b> The ninja are helping in fixing Ninjago City after the Great Devourer was defeated. Nya informs them that she has found a real-estate agent named Patty Keys who will help them find a place to live. Nya and Sensei Wu than leave to find parts for the Ultra Sonic Raider. Sensei also reminds the ninja that their new mission is to train Lloyd. Meanwhile, Skales along with the other snake-tribe generals attempt to regain the trust of the Serpentine after Pythor’s defeat. However, Lord Garmadon persuades what remains of the Serpentine Army to follow him, and recreates the remains of Destiny’s Bounty into a ship he names “The Black Bounty”. In the meantime, Patty Keys finds an apartment for the ninja called the “Hero Suite” with a training-room suitable to train Lloyd. The apartment is expensive, so the Ninja decide to get jobs to pay for the rent, with Cole as a bank security officer, Jay a pizza delivery man, Kai a child entertainer, and Zane a sushi chef. This goes well in the beginning, but then turns out not so favorable. After stopping the Generals from kidnapping Lloyd and having Skales arrested, they settle for the lower-class flat. Meanwhile Lord Garmadon and the Serpentine fly to the Golden Peaks – birthplace of the Golden Weapons - and fuses the Weapons together into a Mega Weapon. He plans to use it to destroy Sensei and the ninja so they will never be able to train Lloyd, then the prophecy will never be fulfilled.</p>

<td class="description" colspan="3" style="border-bottom:solid 3px #Gold">The Episode begins a few centuries ago, with the pirate crew of the Destiny’s Bounty led by Captain Soto looking for the 'Island of Darkness'. The crew leaves No Eyed Pete to steer the ship when the captain wasn’t noticing, but due to his lack of sight the ship crashes. In the present time, the ninja are training Lloyd in their smaller and more affordable apartment, but looking for a better place to train. On the Black Bounty, Lord Garmadon is discussing the Mega Weapon with the snake-generals, and he tries to use it to destroy the Ultra Dragon, who happens to be flying by. He is outraged when he is unable to destroy the dragon, but discovers Captain Soto’s journal in the ship’s cabin and accidentally resurrects the pirate-crew using the Mega Weapon. Meanwhile, the Ninja find “Grand Sensei Dareth’s Mojo Dojo”. Dareth agrees to let them use his Dojo if they defeat him in a battle. Of course they do, and Dareth allows them to use his Dojo. In the meantime Lord Garmadon realizes that the Mega Weapon does not have the power to destroy, only to create, and it also drains his strength every time he uses it, so he needs time to recover. The pirates lock up Garmadon and the snakes. The Ninja start training Lloyd at the Dojo, where he demonstrates his extraordinary talents. The Pirates then attack Ninjago City, taking all the money they can get. Sensei Dareth, dressed as the Brown Ninja, jumps on ship but gets captured by the pirates. The Ninja go to his rescue, and while battling the pirate captain, Lloyd unlocks his Spinjitzu the first time. The pirates are later arrested, and Lord Garmadon takes back the Black Bounty.</td>

Garmadon, after seeing his own reflection in the Mega-weapon, creates four dark versions of the Ninjas, and sends them to destroy the Ninja. Meanwhile, Jay is trying to teach Lloyd to harness the power of Lightning, when they get word of a ceremony at Darkly's School for "Great Students". But it turns out to be a trap, as the boys kidnap the Ninja and try to turn Lloyd back to their side. The Ninjas escape with the teachers, but are confronted by Garmadon's evil creations, who have been wreaking havoc and assaulted Sensei Wu (the Dark Jay even kissing Nya). The Ninjas try to stop them, but realize that they can't defeat their evil clones. Lloyd convinces the boys to be good, and they make Ninja suits and attack the Evil Ninjas.

<td class="description" colspan="3" style="border-bottom:solid 3px #Gold">The episode begins with Lloyd lamenting that he must train and not play with others or enjoy his youth. Nya then tells the Ninja that Lord Garmadon has been spotted at the city museum. Once there, Lord Garmadon tells his Serpentine followers that he is going to awaken the long dead Grundle, an ancient fierce dinosaur-like creature, and make it hunt the Ninja. In the middle of this process, the Ninja interrupt. They jump on the fossil, but nothing seems to happen at all. Garmadon leaves in a fury, while the Serpentine Generals try to steal a golden sarcophagus for compensation, though they soon leave it behind. The Ninja go after them, but fall behind, and then realize they have been turned into kids by the Mega-weapon's blast. Accused of the thefts, the Ninja try to perform Spinjitzu, but fail dismally, and then the museum director asks them why the Grundle fossil is gone too. The Ninja realize it must have been re-awakened and walked off. To escape, the Ninja disguise themselves and run away with some school kids, while the beast reappears and scares everyone from the museum. The Ninja call Lloyd and they meet at the arcade, where Lloyd is shocked at what happened to them. He brings them to a comic writer he knows, Rufus "Mother Doomsday" McCallister, to ask him for advice. The writer tells him that any other weapons would not break through its tough shell,although a couple of illuma-swords would work well, as the Grundle is nocturnal and vulnerable to light , but they must win them in a comic knowledge competition. They call Sensei and Nya and tell them what happened. Sensei and Nya then go to the tea lady Miss Take for Tomorrow Tea to turn the Ninja back into their older selves and the Grundle back into bones. Meanwhile, the Grundle shows up at the comic shop, but using the illuma-swords and Lloyd´s powers they manage to hold the monster at bay until Sensei and Nya turn up. Lloyd uses the tea to undo the spell of the Mega-Weapon on the Grundle and the Ninja, but it also makes Lloyd become an older version of himself. The episode ends with Rufus handing Lloyd a comic, saying he has earned it. Lloyd declines, saying he already knows how it ends. It is a comic where Lloyd faces off against his father under the stylized title of "Green Ninja".</td>

<p>While training Lloyd, the Ninja find out that the Serpentine have returned to the Lost City of Ouroboros and are preparing their vehicles for an all-out assault. The Ninja, together with Lloyd (who has now begun to harness his immense potential), attack and begin to defeat the Serpentine, with Lloyd freezing Garmadon's Mega-weapon. Retreating, Garmadon comes up with a master plan; he will travel back in time and make sure the Ninja are never brought together, changing history in his favor. As he escapes through the time-portal he wishes into existence, the Ninja follow him. They arrive on the very day Nya was kidnapped and Kai was recruited by Sensei Wu. As he leaves the 4-Weapons shop, the Ninja take Wu aside and tell him what is at stake, so that when the Skeletons arrive, history apparently starts repeating itself. But Garmadon, disguised as a Skeleton, makes sure Nya's kidnapping fails and the Ninja are forced to take matters into their own hands to make sure history runs its course, going as far as kidnapping Nya and handing her over to the Skeletons. But Garmadon joins forces with his past self and goes to the Fire Temple, resting place of the Sword of Fire, and prepares to defeat Kai. The Ninja from the present arrive and fight back, before realizing that the only way to heal the damage done is to destroy the Mega-Weapon. Using the Golden Weapons, which Jay has seemingly stolen from their past selves, the Ninja, with the help of Sensei Wu, destroy the Mega-Weapon, and everything changes back to the way it was, removing the Mega-weapon from the timeline. When everything resets, no-one but the Ninja seem to remember the Mega-Weapon existed, seemingly confirming that their quest has become far easier.</p>

<p>As the Serpentine battle in the City of Ouroboros, Garmadon arrives with his master plan; he has remembered the 'Island of Darkness' mentioned in Captain Soto's logs and plans to find it, and use its power for himself. While they are at sea, the Serpentine Generals betray him, throwing him from their Rattlecopter into the sea, and Skales is declared their leader. Meanwhile, the Ninja are called to the Museum of History to confront a strange force; venom from the Great Devourer has leaked into the sewers and brought a mass of tiny stone warriors to life. The Ninja easily defeat them, then meet up with Sensei Wu and Misako, who is revealed to be Lloyd's mother. Lloyd, bitter about Misako apparently abandoning him, finds out that his mother has been trying to find a way of restoring the balance without endangering either Lloyd or Garmadon. To this end, she reveals the full story of Ninjago; in the beginning, there was the First Spinjitzu Master, but against him was pitted a being called the Overlord, the first and greatest dark power. The Overlord created the Stone Warriors to aid him in battle, and, to prevent good losing the battle, the First Spinjitzu Master split the land he had created in two, with the Overlord trapped on the dark half of Ninjago, which vanished. Even as Misako is explaining, the venom of the Devourer brings a huge, four-armed stone warrior to life. It immediately goes on the rampage and pursues the Ninja through the museum. Thankfully, they coordinate and trick the Stone Warrior into toppling down the bottomless pit where he was found. After this, Misako joines the group. Meanwhile, Garmadon washes up on an unknown tropical island and is guided by an unseen force (aka the Overlord) to a stone monument atop the island, with four levers perfectly suited for him. He turns them, and the other half of Ninjago, corrupted by the Overlord's shadow, rises around him.</p>

At the Mojo Dojo, Lloyd is continuing his training, while Sensei Wu and Misako prepare to go over her research on the prophecy; Wu is slightly uncomfortable because of her relationship with Garmadon and the fact that he could have been her husband. Everything is stopped when the Serpentine begin their destructive campaign, sending the city into chaos. But the Serpentine come up against a barrier, an ancient door inscribed with carvings which look like Skales. He finds a switch which opens the doorway, revealing a vault where the Stone Army rest.

He tells Garmadon that they need a Super-Weapon unlike anything ever seen. Back in Ninjago, Zane sends his falcon to investigate the island. while the other Ninja and Nya try to repair the Bounty. It is hopeless, and the Ninja despair of defeating the Stone Army. It is then that Misako tells them of the Temple of Light, where the Golden Weapons were imbued with their powers. There, the Ninja can unlock their True Potential on their own and supercharge Lloyd, enabling him to defeat the Stone Army. They set sail for the Dark Island on the Bounty, leaving Dareth to guard the escapees from Ninjago. During the voyage, the falcon reaches the Dark Island and all are witness to it being attacked and seemingly destroyed. The Bounty is then struck by a storm and attacked by starteeth, vicious ship-eating creatures that leave the Bounty without any steering, a damaged mast and a hole in their side. They eventually run aground on an uncharted island with a lighthouse. There, they find Zane's father, the Tinkerer. While he entertains them, the Tinkerer explains that after he flicked Zane's memory switch and died, Samukai arrived and brought him back to life, forcing him to construct their advanced war machines. To make sure he did not escape from the island, the Skeletons chained a Leviathan to keep guard. Though Zane is glad to see his father again, the Tinkerer was always afraid that Zane might be ashamed of him for creating the weapons for the Skeleton Army, but Zane soon dispels his fears. Zane's father agrees to repair the Bounty, but just as they are setting off, the Leviathan attacks. Zane dives overboard and cuts the chain holding the creature in place. In return for this, the Leviathan releases the Bounty. When asked by Sensei Wu how he knew the beast would do that, Zane explains that nothing deserves to be held captive, even a monster. With the creature freed and the Tinkerer on board, the Bounty, once again airborne, continues its journey to the Dark Island.</td>

<p><b>Season Premiere:</b> The ninja are helping in fixing Ninjago City after the Great Devourer was defeated. Nya informs them that she has found a real-estate agent named Patty Keys who will help them find a place to live. Nya and Sensei Wu than leave to find parts for the Ultra Sonic Raider. Sensei also reminds the ninja that their new mission is to train Lloyd. Meanwhile, Skales along with the other snake-tribe generals attempt to regain the trust of the Serpentine after Pythor’s defeat. However, Lord Garmadon persuades what remains of the Serpentine Army to follow him, and recreates the remains of Destiny’s Bounty into a ship he names “The Black Bounty”. In the meantime, Patty Keys finds an apartment for the ninja called the “Hero Suite” with a training-room suitable to train Lloyd. The apartment is expensive, so the Ninja decide to get jobs to pay for the rent, with Cole as a bank security officer, Jay a pizza delivery man, Kai a child entertainer, and Zane a sushi chef. This goes well in the beginning, but then turns out not so favorable. After stopping the Generals from kidnapping Lloyd and having Skales arrested, they settle for the lower-class flat. Meanwhile Lord Garmadon and the Serpentine fly to the Golden Peaks – birthplace of the Golden Weapons - and fuses the Weapons together into a Mega Weapon. He plans to use it to destroy Sensei and the ninja so they will never be able to train Lloyd, then the prophecy will never be fulfilled.</p>

<td class="description" colspan="3" style="border-bottom:solid 3px #Gold">The Episode begins a few centuries ago, with the pirate crew of the Destiny’s Bounty led by Captain Soto looking for the 'Island of Darkness'. The crew leaves No Eyed Pete to steer the ship when the captain wasn’t noticing, but due to his lack of sight the ship crashes. In the present time, the ninja are training Lloyd in their smaller and more affordable apartment, but looking for a better place to train. On the Black Bounty, Lord Garmadon is discussing the Mega Weapon with the snake-generals, and he tries to use it to destroy the Ultra Dragon, who happens to be flying by. He is outraged when he is unable to destroy the dragon, but discovers Captain Soto’s journal in the ship’s cabin and accidentally resurrects the pirate-crew using the Mega Weapon. Meanwhile, the Ninja find “Grand Sensei Dareth’s Mojo Dojo”. Dareth agrees to let them use his Dojo if they defeat him in a battle. Of course they do, and Dareth allows them to use his Dojo. In the meantime Lord Garmadon realizes that the Mega Weapon does not have the power to destroy, only to create, and it also drains his strength every time he uses it, so he needs time to recover. The pirates lock up Garmadon and the snakes. The Ninja start training Lloyd at the Dojo, where he demonstrates his extraordinary talents. The Pirates then attack Ninjago City, taking all the money they can get. Sensei Dareth, dressed as the Brown Ninja, jumps on ship but gets captured by the pirates. The Ninja go to his rescue, and while battling the pirate captain, Lloyd unlocks his Spinjitzu the first time. The pirates are later arrested, and Lord Garmadon takes back the Black Bounty.</td>

Garmadon, after seeing his own reflection in the Mega-weapon, creates four dark versions of the Ninjas, and sends them to destroy the Ninja. Meanwhile, Jay is trying to teach Lloyd to harness the power of Lightning, when they get word of a ceremony at Darkly's School for "Great Students". But it turns out to be a trap, as the boys kidnap the Ninja and try to turn Lloyd back to their side. The Ninjas escape with the teachers, but are confronted by Garmadon's evil creations, who have been wreaking havoc and assaulted Sensei Wu (the Dark Jay even kissing Nya). The Ninjas try to stop them, but realize that they can't defeat their evil clones. Lloyd convinces the boys to be good, and they make Ninja suits and attack the Evil Ninjas. After destroying Garmadon's inventions, the teachers decide to celebrate. The Ninjas drive back to Ninjago City in the Ultra Sonic Raider, and receive a message from Lord Garmadon saying that he will be back.</td>

The Ninja in the Ultra Sonic Raider and on the Ultra Dragon, their opposition include: the Serpentine Bus, who have just broken Skales out of jail, police, The Black Bounty, Kruncha and Nuckal, the royal blacksmiths, Ed and Edna, The boarding school for bad boys, Turbo boosted Mailman bike and the pirate van. The pirates, mailman, and royal blacksmiths crash and are eliminated. The Ninja run out of fuel, but Ed and Edna come and help, they transfer fuel to the Ultra Sonic Raider. The Serpentine jump from the Dark Bounty to the Ultra Sonic Raider in attempt to stop the Ninja. Ed and Edna crash, and Jay takes a part to assure their car crosses the finish line. The Ninja speed on, and are winning, but in the final stretch, Lord Garmadon uses his Mega Weapon to create a giant crevasse in the ground. Kai uses a secret weapon installed by Nya and transfers the Ultra Sonic Raider into its flying form. The race is a photo finish, and the Ninja win thanks to the part Jay took from his parent's car. Garmadon is enraged, since 'his ship is bigger'. But Lloyd takes back the Bounty, and the cops try to arrest the Dark Lord. The Serpentine bus drives in and picks up Garmadon, and Darreth, together with the other Ninja, celebrate the salvation of the Dojo.</td>

<td class="description" colspan="3" style="border-bottom:solid 3px #Gold">The episode begins with Lloyd lamenting that he must train and not play with others or enjoy his youth. Nya then tells the Ninja that Lord Garmadon has been spotted at the city museum. Once there, Lord Garmadon tells his Serpentine followers that he is going to awaken the long dead Grundle, an ancient fierce dinosaur-like creature, and make it hunt the Ninja. In the middle of this process, the Ninja interrupt. They jump on the fossil, but nothing seems to happen at all. Garmadon leaves in a fury, while the Serpentine Generals try to steal a golden sarcophagus for compensation, though they soon leave it behind. The Ninja go after them, but fall behind, and then realize they have been turned into kids by the Mega-weapon's blast. Accused of the thefts, the Ninja try to perform Spinjitzu, but fail dismally, and then the museum director asks them why the Grundle fossil is gone too. The Ninja realize it must have been re-awakened and walked off. To escape, the Ninja disguise themselves and run away with some school kids, while the beast reappears and scares everyone from the museum. The Ninja call Lloyd and they meet at the arcade, where Lloyd is shocked at what happened to them. He brings them to a comic writer he knows, Rufus "Mother Doomsday" McCallister, to ask him for advice. The writer tells him that any other weapons would not break through its tough shell,although a couple of illuma-swords would work well, as the Grundle is nocturnal and vulnerable to light , but they must win them in a comic knowledge competition. They call Sensei and Nya and tell them what happened. Sensei and Nya then go to the tea lady Miss Take for Tomorrow Tea to turn the Ninja back into their older selves and the Grundle back into bones. Meanwhile, the Grundle shows up at the comic shop, but using the illuma-swords and Lloyd´s powers they manage to hold the monster at bay until Sensei and Nya turn up. Lloyd uses the tea to undo the spell of the Mega-Weapon on the Grundle and the Ninja, but it also makes Lloyd become an older version of himself. The episode ends with Rufus handing Lloyd a comic, saying he has earned it. Lloyd declines, saying he already knows how it ends. It is a comic where Lloyd faces off against his father under the stylized title of "Green Ninja".</td>

<p>While training Lloyd, the Ninja find out that the Serpentine have returned to the Lost City of Ouroboros and are preparing their vehicles for an all-out assault. The Ninja, together with Lloyd (who has now begun to harness his immense potential), attack and begin to defeat the Serpentine, with Lloyd freezing Garmadon's Mega-weapon. Retreating, Garmadon comes up with a master plan; he will travel back in time and make sure the Ninja are never brought together, changing history in his favor. As he escapes through the time-portal he wishes into existence, the Ninja follow him. They arrive on the very day Nya was kidnapped and Kai was recruited by Sensei Wu. As he leaves the 4-Weapons shop, the Ninja take Wu aside and tell him what is at stake, so that when the Skeletons arrive, history apparently starts repeating itself. But Garmadon, disguised as a Skeleton, makes sure Nya's kidnapping fails and the Ninja are forced to take matters into their own hands to make sure history runs its course, going as far as kidnapping Nya and handing her over to the Skeletons. But Garmadon joins forces with his past self and goes to the Fire Temple, resting place of the Sword of Fire, and prepares to defeat Kai. The Ninja from the present arrive and fight back, before realizing that the only way to heal the damage done is to destroy the Mega-Weapon. Using the Golden Weapons, which Jay has seemingly stolen from their past selves, the Ninja, with the help of Sensei Wu, destroy the Mega-Weapon, and everything changes back to the way it was, removing the Mega-weapon from the timeline. When everything resets, no-one but the Ninja seem to remember the Mega-Weapon existed, seemingly confirming that their quest has become far easier.</p>

<p>As the Serpentine battle in the City of Ouroboros, Garmadon arrives with his master plan; he has remembered the 'Island of Darkness' mentioned in Captain Soto's logs and plans to find it, and use its power for himself. While they are at sea, the Serpentine Generals betray him, throwing him from their Rattlecopter into the sea, and Skales is declared their leader. Meanwhile, the Ninja are called to the Museum of History to confront a strange force; venom from the Great Devourer has leaked into the sewers and brought a mass of tiny stone warriors to life. The Ninja easily defeat them, then meet up with Sensei Wu and Misako, who is revealed to be Lloyd's mother. Lloyd, bitter about Misako apparently abandoning him, finds out that his mother has been trying to find a way of restoring the balance without endangering either Lloyd or Garmadon. To this end, she reveals the full story of Ninjago; in the beginning, there was the First Spinjitzu Master, but against him was pitted a being called the Overlord, the first and greatest dark power. The Overlord created the Stone Warriors to aid him in battle, and, to prevent good losing the battle, the First Spinjitzu Master split the land he had created in two, with the Overlord trapped on the dark half of Ninjago, which vanished. Even as Misako is explaining, the venom of the Devourer brings a huge, four-armed stone warrior to life. It immediately goes on the rampage and pursues the Ninja through the museum. Thankfully, they coordinate and trick the Stone Warrior into toppling down the bottomless pit where he was found. After this, Misako joines the group. Meanwhile, Garmadon washes up on an unknown tropical island and is guided by an unseen force (aka the Overlord) to a stone monument atop the island, with four levers perfectly suited for him. He turns them, and the other half of Ninjago, corrupted by the Overlord's shadow, rises around him.</p>

At the Mojo Dojo, Lloyd is continuing his training, while Sensei Wu and Misako prepare to go over her research on the prophecy; Wu is slightly uncomfortable because of her relationship with Garmadon and the fact that he could have been her husband. Everything is stopped when the Serpentine begin their destructive campaign, sending the city into chaos. But the Serpentine come up against a barrier, an ancient door inscribed with carvings which look like Skales. He finds a switch which opens the doorway, revealing a vault where the Stone Army rest. The Great Devourer's venom melts through the roof of the vault and starts dripping on the statues, bringing them to life. They defeat the Serpentine and exit the vault, which closes behind them, trapping Skales and his people underground once again. The Stone Army rises and the city begins to evacuate, with the Ninja providing transport for those left behind, including comic-book writer Rufus, Dareth and the Bank Manager. The Ninja, with Lloyd, Nya and the Ultra-Dragon, gather the people and flee Ninjago City, though Misako stays behind to get her research and she and Sensei Wu are nearly left behind. Meanwhile, on the Dark Island, Garmadon is guided by the Overlord to an ancient orrery-like clock, designed to count down to the final battle. Garmadon dons the Helmet of Shadows, which both starts the clock and gives him command over the Stone Army.</td>

It is hopeless, and the Ninja despair of defeating the Stone Army. It is then that Misako tells them of the Temple of Light, where the Golden Weapons were imbued with their powers. There, the Ninja can unlock their True Potential on their own and supercharge Lloyd, enabling him to defeat the Stone Army.

They eventually run aground on an uncharted island with a lighthouse. There, they find Zane's father, the Tinkerer. While he entertains them, the Tinkerer explains that after he flicked Zane's memory switch and died, Samukai arrived and brought him back to life, forcing him to construct their advanced war machines.
