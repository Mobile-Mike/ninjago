<td class="description" colspan="3" style="border-bottom:solid 3px #Red">An old wanderer appears at 'Four Weapons' a weapons shop, run by Kai and his sister Nya. He talks about the weapons do not work for a Ninja. When Kai tries to show him around he disappears. Suddenly, the skeletons and their leader, 'Samukai' appear in the town to steal a map. Despite Kai and Nya's fighting attempts, along with the old man's 'Spinjitzu, the skeletons steal the map and kidnap Nya. The stranger explains the story of Ninjago. He says that Ninjago was created by the first Spinjitzu master using the four golden weapons. His two sons swore to protect them but one of them was consumed by darkness and wanted the weapons for himself. The younger brother defeated his brother and hid the weapons and guarded them with dragons. He drew a map to discover the weapons and gave it to Kai's father to hide. He reveals he is the younger brother and his brother is Lord Garmadon. He trains Kai to become a Ninja by training him. During the night, he is suddenly attacked by 3 unknown Ninja!</td>

Sensei Wu says that if they work together they can accomplish the ultimate move, the 'Tornado of Creation.' They discover the Golden Shurikens of ice and are confronted by an Ice Dragon. They manage to escape using an ice slide. They next get to the Nun-chucks of lightning. They easily escape the lightning dragon but are being followed by Samukai's army. They celebrate in a camp near to the last weapon, the sword of fire. Kai wakes up to find Nya running away from him so he chases her down to a Volcano where the last weapon is. Nya turns out to be a trap and becomes Lord Garmadon's shadow and forces Kai to get the Fire sword so he can rescue Nya from the chains. Garmadon hurts him in his shadow form while Kai is defenceless, but luckily Wu shows up and battles their shadows. Samukai then shows up at the Ninja's camp and takes the other 3 weapons. Wu gets the sword when the Fire Guardian appears and goes to the Underworld to escape. Samukai is commanded to go to the underworld alongside Garmadon, but the ninja escape and chase after the skeletons while they are teleporting to the Underworld. The skeletons escape the ninja and the ninja are left behind, clueless of what to do next... how will Garmadon be stopped?</td>

Each ninja then get the dragons of their elements and they all cross over to the Underworld. They see an evil fortress run by the skeletons. They climb across vines, but then realise they're the legs of spiders. The spiders and the skeletons team up on the Ninja. Meanwhile Wu discovers Lord Garmadon. Samukai then shows up with the three other weapons and they fight. To defeat both spiders and skeletons they combine their Spinjitzu and form the Tornado of Creation, destroying all enemies and turning them into a Ferris Wheel. They get to Wu, where they see him fighting Samukai. Sensei is defeated and Samukai claims all four. Garmadon commands him to give the weapons to him, but the Skeleton King betrays him and keeps them for himself. Garmadon had already predicted this so that when Samukai was destroyed by the four weapons power it would open a vortex to another world. Lord Garmadon escapes with the words "You were always father's favourite." The Ninja return to Nya on their dragons with a happy ending. They know Garmadon will return, but they will be ready to stop him.</td>

After being scolded by Sensei Wu, Nya comes running in, announcing that Lord Garmadon had returned and was spotted heading to Jamanakai Village. The Ninja rush off and fly there on their dragons. When they arrive, the supposed "Lord Garmadon" was actually Lloyd Garmadon, his son. Lloyd tried to steal the candy from the village, but the Ninja stopped him. As the Ninja head back to the Monastery, Lloyd accidentally stumbles upon the ancient Serpentine tomb of the Hypnobrai. Slithraa, the Hypnobrai general, accidentally hypnotizes himself and Lloyd controls him. Back at the monastery, the Ninja tried to have a tournament to see who was the destined Green Ninja, with Kai almost sets the place on fire with his sword. The sensei scolds the Ninja, and Lloyd takes over Jamanakai Village where Nya is at the moment. The Ninja rush off to save her and find the entire village was hypnotized by the snakes. The Ninja fight and the snakes retreat, except Skales who partially hypnotized Cole. The Ninja and Nya, along with Sensei, head back to the monastery to train against Lloyd and the Serpentine.</td>

<td class="description" colspan="3" style="border-bottom:solid 3px #Gold">The Episode begins a few centuries ago, with the pirate crew of the Destiny’s Bounty led by Captain Soto looking for the 'Island of Darkness'. The crew leaves No Eyed Pete to steer the ship when the captain wasn’t noticing, but due to his lack of sight the ship crashes. In the present time, the ninja are training Lloyd in their smaller and more affordable apartment, but looking for a better place to train. On the Black Bounty, Lord Garmadon is discussing the Mega Weapon with the snake-generals, and he tries to use it to destroy the Ultra Dragon, who happens to be flying by. He is outraged when he is unable to destroy the dragon, but discovers Captain Soto’s journal in the ship’s cabin and accidentally resurrects the pirate-crew using the Mega Weapon. Meanwhile, the Ninja find “Grand Sensei Dareth’s Mojo Dojo”. Dareth agrees to let them use his Dojo if they defeat him in a battle. Of course they do, and Dareth allows them to use his Dojo. In the meantime Lord Garmadon realizes that the Mega Weapon does not have the power to destroy, only to create, and it also drains his strength every time he uses it, so he needs time to recover. The pirates lock up Garmadon and the snakes. The Ninja start training Lloyd at the Dojo, where he demonstrates his extraordinary talents. The Pirates then attack Ninjago City, taking all the money they can get. Sensei Dareth, dressed as the Brown Ninja, jumps on ship but gets captured by the pirates. The Ninja go to his rescue, and while battling the pirate captain, Lloyd unlocks his Spinjitzu the first time. The pirates are later arrested, and Lord Garmadon takes back the Black Bounty.</td>

<td class="description" colspan="3" style="border-bottom:solid 3px #Gold">When the Ninja learn that Dareth's Mojo Dojo is to be destroyed and Dareth doesn't have the money to save it, our heroes enter the annual NinjaBall Run, a massive road-race across Ninjago, to win its cash prize in order to save the dojo. The Ninja in the Ultra Sonic Raider and on the Ultra Dragon, their opposition include: the Serpentine Bus, who have just broken Skales out of jail, police, The Black Bounty, Kruncha and Nuckal, the royal blacksmiths, Ed and Edna, The boarding school for bad boys, Turbo boosted Mailman bike and the pirate van. The pirates, mailman, and royal blacksmiths crash and are eliminated. The Ninja run out of fuel, but Ed and Edna come and help, they transfer fuel to the Ultra Sonic Raider. The Serpentine jump from the Dark Bounty to the Ultra Sonic Raider in attempt to stop the Ninja. Ed and Edna crash, and Jay takes a part to assure their car crosses the finish line. The Ninja speed on, and are winning, but in the final stretch, Lord Garmadon uses his Mega Weapon to create a giant crevasse in the ground. Kai uses a secret weapon installed by Nya and transfers the Ultra Sonic Raider into its flying form. The race is a photo finish, and the Ninja win thanks to the part Jay took from his parent's car. Garmadon is enraged, since 'his ship is bigger'. But Lloyd takes back the Bounty, and the cops try to arrest the Dark Lord. The Serpentine bus drives in and picks up Garmadon, and Darreth, together with the other Ninja, celebrate the salvation of the Dojo.</td>

<td class="description" colspan="3" style="border-bottom:solid 3px #Gold">The episode begins with Lloyd lamenting that he must train and not play with others or enjoy his youth. Nya then tells the Ninja that Lord Garmadon has been spotted at the city museum. Once there, Lord Garmadon tells his Serpentine followers that he is going to awaken the long dead Grundle, an ancient fierce dinosaur-like creature, and make it hunt the Ninja. In the middle of this process, the Ninja interrupt. They jump on the fossil, but nothing seems to happen at all. Garmadon leaves in a fury, while the Serpentine Generals try to steal a golden sarcophagus for compensation, though they soon leave it behind. The Ninja go after them, but fall behind, and then realize they have been turned into kids by the Mega-weapon's blast. Accused of the thefts, the Ninja try to perform Spinjitzu, but fail dismally, and then the museum director asks them why the Grundle fossil is gone too. The Ninja realize it must have been re-awakened and walked off. To escape, the Ninja disguise themselves and run away with some school kids, while the beast reappears and scares everyone from the museum. The Ninja call Lloyd and they meet at the arcade, where Lloyd is shocked at what happened to them. He brings them to a comic writer he knows, Rufus "Mother Doomsday" McCallister, to ask him for advice. The writer tells him that any other weapons would not break through its tough shell,although a couple of illuma-swords would work well, as the Grundle is nocturnal and vulnerable to light , but they must win them in a comic knowledge competition. They call Sensei and Nya and tell them what happened. Sensei and Nya then go to the tea lady Miss Take for Tomorrow Tea to turn the Ninja back into their older selves and the Grundle back into bones. Meanwhile, the Grundle shows up at the comic shop, but using the illuma-swords and Lloyd´s powers they manage to hold the monster at bay until Sensei and Nya turn up. Lloyd uses the tea to undo the spell of the Mega-Weapon on the Grundle and the Ninja, but it also makes Lloyd become an older version of himself. The episode ends with Rufus handing Lloyd a comic, saying he has earned it. Lloyd declines, saying he already knows how it ends. It is a comic where Lloyd faces off against his father under the stylized title of "Green Ninja".</td>

<p>While training Lloyd, the Ninja find out that the Serpentine have returned to the Lost City of Ouroboros and are preparing their vehicles for an all-out assault. The Ninja, together with Lloyd (who has now begun to harness his immense potential), attack and begin to defeat the Serpentine, with Lloyd freezing Garmadon's Mega-weapon. Retreating, Garmadon comes up with a master plan; he will travel back in time and make sure the Ninja are never brought together, changing history in his favor. As he escapes through the time-portal he wishes into existence, the Ninja follow him. They arrive on the very day Nya was kidnapped and Kai was recruited by Sensei Wu. As he leaves the 4-Weapons shop, the Ninja take Wu aside and tell him what is at stake, so that when the Skeletons arrive, history apparently starts repeating itself. But Garmadon, disguised as a Skeleton, makes sure Nya's kidnapping fails and the Ninja are forced to take matters into their own hands to make sure history runs its course, going as far as kidnapping Nya and handing her over to the Skeletons. But Garmadon joins forces with his past self and goes to the Fire Temple, resting place of the Sword of Fire, and prepares to defeat Kai. The Ninja from the present arrive and fight back, before realizing that the only way to heal the damage done is to destroy the Mega-Weapon. Using the Golden Weapons, which Jay has seemingly stolen from their past selves, the Ninja, with the help of Sensei Wu, destroy the Mega-Weapon, and everything changes back to the way it was, removing the Mega-weapon from the timeline. When everything resets, no-one but the Ninja seem to remember the Mega-Weapon existed, seemingly confirming that their quest has become far easier.</p>

<p>As the Serpentine battle in the City of Ouroboros, Garmadon arrives with his master plan; he has remembered the 'Island of Darkness' mentioned in Captain Soto's logs and plans to find it, and use its power for himself. While they are at sea, the Serpentine Generals betray him, throwing him from their Rattlecopter into the sea, and Skales is declared their leader. Meanwhile, the Ninja are called to the Museum of History to confront a strange force; venom from the Great Devourer has leaked into the sewers and brought a mass of tiny stone warriors to life. The Ninja easily defeat them, then meet up with Sensei Wu and Misako, who is revealed to be Lloyd's mother. Lloyd, bitter about Misako apparently abandoning him, finds out that his mother has been trying to find a way of restoring the balance without endangering either Lloyd or Garmadon. To this end, she reveals the full story of Ninjago; in the beginning, there was the First Spinjitzu Master, but against him was pitted a being called the Overlord, the first and greatest dark power. The Overlord created the Stone Warriors to aid him in battle, and, to prevent good losing the battle, the First Spinjitzu Master split the land he had created in two, with the Overlord trapped on the dark half of Ninjago, which vanished. Even as Misako is explaining, the venom of the Devourer brings a huge, four-armed stone warrior to life. It immediately goes on the rampage and pursues the Ninja through the museum. Thankfully, they coordinate and trick the Stone Warrior into toppling down the bottomless pit where he was found. After this, Misako joines the group. Meanwhile, Garmadon washes up on an unknown tropical island and is guided by an unseen force (aka the Overlord) to a stone monument atop the island, with four levers perfectly suited for him. He turns them, and the other half of Ninjago, corrupted by the Overlord's shadow, rises around him.</p>

At the Mojo Dojo, Lloyd is continuing his training, while Sensei Wu and Misako prepare to go over her research on the prophecy; Wu is slightly uncomfortable because of her relationship with Garmadon and the fact that he could have been her husband. Everything is stopped when the Serpentine begin their destructive campaign, sending the city into chaos. But the Serpentine come up against a barrier, an ancient door inscribed with carvings which look like Skales. He finds a switch which opens the doorway, revealing a vault where the Stone Army rest. The Great Devourer's venom melts through the roof of the vault and starts dripping on the statues, bringing them to life. They defeat the Serpentine and exit the vault, which closes behind them, trapping Skales and his people underground once again. The Stone Army rises and the city begins to evacuate, with the Ninja providing transport for those left behind, including comic-book writer Rufus, Dareth and the Bank Manager. The Ninja, with Lloyd, Nya and the Ultra-Dragon, gather the people and flee Ninjago City, though Misako stays behind to get her research and she and Sensei Wu are nearly left behind. Meanwhile, on the Dark Island, Garmadon is guided by the Overlord to an ancient orrery-like clock, designed to count down to the final battle. Garmadon dons the Helmet of Shadows, which both starts the clock and gives him command over the Stone Army.</td>

He tells Garmadon that they need a Super-Weapon unlike anything ever seen. Back in Ninjago, Zane sends his falcon to investigate the island. while the other Ninja and Nya try to repair the Bounty. It is hopeless, and the Ninja despair of defeating the Stone Army. It is then that Misako tells them of the Temple of Light, where the Golden Weapons were imbued with their powers. There, the Ninja can unlock their True Potential on their own and supercharge Lloyd, enabling him to defeat the Stone Army. They set sail for the Dark Island on the Bounty, leaving Dareth to guard the escapees from Ninjago. During the voyage, the falcon reaches the Dark Island and all are witness to it being attacked and seemingly destroyed. The Bounty is then struck by a storm and attacked by starteeth, vicious ship-eating creatures that leave the Bounty without any steering, a damaged mast and a hole in their side. They eventually run aground on an uncharted island with a lighthouse. There, they find Zane's father, the Tinkerer. While he entertains them, the Tinkerer explains that after he flicked Zane's memory switch and died, Samukai arrived and brought him back to life, forcing him to construct their advanced war machines. To make sure he did not escape from the island, the Skeletons chained a Leviathan to keep guard. Though Zane is glad to see his father again, the Tinkerer was always afraid that Zane might be ashamed of him for creating the weapons for the Skeleton Army, but Zane soon dispels his fears. Zane's father agrees to repair the Bounty, but just as they are setting off, the Leviathan attacks. Zane dives overboard and cuts the chain holding the creature in place. In return for this, the Leviathan releases the Bounty. When asked by Sensei Wu how he knew the beast would do that, Zane explains that nothing deserves to be held captive, even a monster. With the creature freed and the Tinkerer on board, the Bounty, once again airborne, continues its journey to the Dark Island.</td>

Risking everything, the Ninja escort Misako into the camp as Stone Warriors. Using her slight influence over Garmadon, Misako manages to get him to remove the Helmet, allowing her to steal it. But the Ninja are spotted and Garmadon, enraged, uses a giant robot to attack them. After a frantic chase through the jungle, the robot is wrecked and Lloyd is given the chance to kill his father. But he is unable to, just as Garmadon is unable to attack his son, much to the Overlord's chagrin. The Ninja get to the Celestial Clock and try desperately to find the Helmet's pedestal with minutes to spare. As the Army arrive, the Ninja find the pedestal and the Clock stops, but too late. The countdown has ended and the Final Battle is upon them. As a mighty energy flare shoots inland from the clock, the Stone Army captures Nya and the Ninja are sent down into a crevasse.

<p>The Ninja launch a rescue mission to get Nya and fight Garmadon once and for all. But when they arrive, they find the Stone Army, Garmadon, Nya and the new Super-Weapon have gone to the coast. The reason for this becomes clear: Garmadon is planning to fire missiles of Darkness into Ninjago, gradually turning it into his own image. The Ninja follow, but are stopped and held up by Nya, who has been polluted with Dark Matter and turned into a slave of the Overlord. They eventually overcome and imprison her, then go to the coast and try to reason with Garmadon. The group try, but Garmadon says he cannot suppress his Evil and the Ninja are not in time to stop the firing of the Dark missiles from the Garmatron. The balance is shifted as Ninjago is infected by Darkness, and the Overlord betrays and possesses Garmadon, using him to retake a physical form and transforming him into a crocodile-like monster. The Ninja realise the real Dark Lord wasn't Garmadon, it was the Overlord. The reincarnated Overlord attacks Lloyd, who fights with him and tries to bring back his father. Garmadon tries, but the Overlord suppresses him and defeats Lloyd, wrecking the Destiny's Bounty in the progress. The Overlord then opens a portal to Ninjago City and goes through with the Garmatron, along with the Stone Army (and Nya). The Ninja are now stranded on the Dark Island, but Lloyd says, after spying a piece of their ship with the 'Destiny' symbol on it: "We didn't lose the war, today we just lost the fight."</p>

Facing the Overlord, Lloyd summons the Golden Dragon and his armor becomes golden, denoting that he has become the next true Spinjitzu Master. Lloyd and Dragon Overlord fight, with the Overlord saying that he can never be defeated, as Light is always balanced with Darkness. Lloyd finally allows himself to be consumed by the Overlord and unleashes a strong burst of inner light, dispersing the Overlord and purging his wicked Shadow from Ninjago and all its inhabitants (including Nya, Cole, Jay, and Zane). As the group gathers together again, Lloyd mourns the loss of his father, only to see him emerging from the rubble, purged of both the Overlord's Darkness and the Great Devourer's venom. As Lloyd, Garmadon and Misako have a private family reunion, the four Ninja vow that, even with the Overlord defeated at last, they will continue to protect Ninjago. The Ninjas and Nya come together, along with Garmadon's family. The episode ends with Sensei Wu and Kai looking at the sun rising above the liberated city.</p>
